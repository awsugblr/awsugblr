Barcamp Bangalore is an open event focused on people, ideas, and collaboration where there is no fixed format or agenda. They call it an un-conference. Barcamp is for and by the community. Barcamp is for anyone who have something interesting to share or want to collaborate with people from a wide range of backgrounds and experience.
