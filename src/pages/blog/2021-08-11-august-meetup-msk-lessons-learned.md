Hello all, after a brief break, the AWS User Group Bengaluru is back with our virtual meetups. For the next meet, our talk will be on Best Practices for Best Practices and Lessons Learned from Enterprise Level MSK (Kafka) deployment on August 26, 2021. Our speakers for the meetup will be [Aruna Kalagnanam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aruna-kalagnanam-a123454/) and [Gayatri Ramasubramaniyan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gayatrir/) from Goldman Sachs

Talk description:

Transaction Banking from Goldman Sachs is a high volume, latency sensitive digital banking platform offering. We have chosen an event driven architecture to build highly decoupled and independent microservices in a cloud native manner and are designed to meet the objectives of Security, Availability Latency and Scalability. AWS MSK (Managed Kafka) was a natural choice – to decouple producers and consumers and to scale easily for high volume processing. However, there are certain aspects that require careful consideration – handling errors and partial failures, managing downtime of consumers, secure communication between brokers and producers / consumers. In this session, we will present the patterns and best practices that helped us build robust event driven applications. We will also present our solution approach that has been reused across multiple application domains. We hope that by sharing our experience, we can establish a reference implementation that application developers can benefit from.
