### About AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019

![](/img/communityday2019/speakers/know-your-speaker-saifur.png)

AWS Community Days are community-organized cloud education events, featuring technical discussions and demos led by expert AWS users and industry leaders from around the world. AWS community is designed to educate everyone about the AWS platform, architecture best practices and about new innovation. The global AWS ecosystem consists of a range of AWS enthusiasts and advocates who are passionate about helping others build. 

It's a great pleasure to have Saifur Rahman Mohsin as a speaker. Let's find out more about the person

### Saifur Rahman Mohsin 

### Intro: 
I was born and grew up in Trichy, TN but moved to Bangalore, KA about 4 years ago. My first gig was an Android workshop that I conducted for college students in my last year of college. From there onwards, I have moved into development and have built web, mobile and voice-driven apps as a full-time freelancer. Besides coding, I enjoy reading books, singing at karaoke, traveling & binge-watching TV shows.

### Job title:
Founder & CEO at Tempestronics

### Fun fact:
I've never worked at a 9-5 job ever & I used to make money by repairing computers when I was growing up--I have fixed over 500 laptops so far.

### Superpower:
Nothing--My favorite superhero is Iron man because he's self-made and despite hailing from a wealthy family he built things entirely on his own (unlike Batman). But if I have to pick a power, it would be superintelligence.
