It's a great pleasure to have Divya Krishnamurthi as a speaker. Let's find out more about the person

### Divya Krishnamurthi 

### Intro: 
Divya Krishnamurthi picked up her first comic book at the age of 6 and it was an instant love.  Between movie nights, she attended University of Maryland, College Park with a Masters in Computer Engineering and has worked in the field for over 12 years as a Developer, Analyst and Lead. When she's not doing either IT or Comics, you can find her dabbling with Technology or at a Tech event around the City. She moved to the dark side when she took up Management 3 years ago and currently moonlights as a Senior Practice Manager at Akamai Technologies.Â 


### Job title:
Akamai Technologies, Senior Practice Manager

### Fun fact:
I have trekked an Active Complex Volcano in Guatemala

### Superpower:
If I were a Superhero, I'd like to have Omnilingualism. I figured it might be interesting to talk to the Korean Superheroes!
