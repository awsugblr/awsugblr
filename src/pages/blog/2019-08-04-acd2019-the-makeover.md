When I sat down to write about AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 experience, it flashed "Why only about what happed on AWS Community Day?" and "Why not what was the effort made over 5 Months to put up this mega event?"  \
For me, in a nutshell, its more of learning to the hearts content to run a start-up IT Company.\
\
The ideation of 3rd AWS Community Day Bengaluru sparkled around mid Jan 2019, while the organizers of AWS User Group Bengaluru ([Jeevan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), [Sathyajith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sathyabhat/), [Runcy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runcyoommen/), [Prashanth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hnprashanth/) & myself, [Bhuvaneswari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvanas/)) wanted to do it bigger and better, [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), the Lead AWS User Group Bengaluru & AWS Community Hero as usual have raised the bar high to have 800+ attendees (close to double compared to [AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2018](http://installjournal.blogspot.com/2018/09/aws-community-day-bengaluru-2018-day.html)), started exploring venues within the city limits. After couple of weeks' exploration and analysis, finalised Hotel Conrad for 27th July 2019 and the started backtracking the timeline with the end goal and big picture in mind.  

* Jeevan started sending note to our long list of Sponsors who have expressed interests in and have been pretty excited to be part of AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019. \
  Call for sponsorships were announced.  Sponsorships have always been Jeevan's forte and he did the best this time as well.
* Most of the discussion & planning happened over awsugblr.slack.com with 3 in-person meetings at cafe coffee day. 
* All task allocation and execution was from Trello. Thanks to Sathyajith for all the project configuration and management.
* Prashanth's team - Akhil & Praveen, took a complete overhaul of the [Community Day website](http://communityday.awsugblr.in) and it was a phenomenal change from [2018 Community Day Website](http://communityday.awsugblr.in/2018). \
  Well, if you are reading this blog after 2019, you may consider looking at http://communityday.awsugblr.in/2019 and http://communityday.awsugblr.in/ or the successive one. 
* **Important dates to remember:  **

  April 10, 2019: Last date for submission of CFP
  April 15, 2019: Speaker list announcement
  July 27, 2019: Day of the event
* [Call for Proposals](https://www.awsugblr.in/blog/2019-03-04-call-for-proposals-for-aws-community-day-bengaluru-2019-are-now-open/) was opened-up on 4th March 2019 and we adhered to the rest of the dates.
* Agenda App was AWSome \
  - It is time aware, shows talks in current time slot when you open
  \- attendee can create his/her own schedule for multi-track events
  \- it has kiosk mode if conference organiser wishes to put this on a screen at the event and since itâ€™s time aware it will always show current talk

If I have the power to hire for a large enterprise, I would hire all of these highly skilled, self-motivated, committed, passionate folks, matured enough to respect & appreciate each others talent. Apparently they are are diversified by their skillsets and multitude of talents but united by common goal with the prime focus to get AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 into flying colours.

Proud to be part of these great minds!
