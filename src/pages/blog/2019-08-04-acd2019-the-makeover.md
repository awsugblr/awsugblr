When I sat down to write about AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 experience, it flashed "Why only about what happed on AWS Community Day?" and "Why not what was the effort made over 5 Months to put up this mega event?"  \
For me, in a nutshell, its more of learning to the hearts content to run a start-up IT Company.\
\
The ideation of 3rd AWS Community Day Bengaluru sparkled around mid Jan 2019, while the organizers of AWS User Group Bengaluru ([Jeevan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), [Sathyajith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sathyabhat/), [Runcy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runcyoommen/), [Prashanth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hnprashanth/) & myself, [Bhuvaneswari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvanas/)) wanted to do it bigger and better, [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), the Lead AWS User Group Bengaluru & AWS Community Hero as usual have raised the bar high to have 800+ attendees (close to double compared to [AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2018](http://installjournal.blogspot.com/2018/09/aws-community-day-bengaluru-2018-day.html)), started exploring venues within the city limits. After couple of weeks' exploration and analysis, finalised Hotel Conrad for 27th July 2019 and the started backtracking the timeline with the end goal and big picture in mind. First this was to look beyond a day's event and thats how workshop was introduced in association with Konfhub

  \- attendee can create his/her own schedule for multi-track events
  \- it has kiosk mode if conference organiser wishes to put this on a screen at the event and since itâ€™s time aware it will always show current talk\
