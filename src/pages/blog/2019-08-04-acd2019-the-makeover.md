When I sat down to write about AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 experience, it flashed "Why only about what happed on AWS Community Day?" and "Why not what was the effort made over 5 Months to put up this mega event?"  \
For me, in a nutshell, its more of learning to the hearts content to run a start-up IT Company.\
\
The ideation of AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 sparkled around mid Jan 2019, while the organizers of AWS User Group Bengaluru ([Jeevan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), [Sathyajith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sathyabhat/), [Runcy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runcyoommen/), [Prashanth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hnprashanth/) & myself, [Bhuvaneswari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvanas/)) wanted to do it bigger and better, [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), the Lead AWS User Group Bengaluru & AWS Community Hero as usual have raised the bar high to have 800+ attendees (close to double compared to [AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2018](http://installjournal.blogspot.com/2018/09/aws-community-day-bengaluru-2018-day.html)), started exploring venues within the city limits. After couple of weeks' exploration and analysis, finalised Hotel Conrad for 27th July 2019 and the started backtracking the timeline with the end goal and big picture in mind. 





If I have the power to hire & setup all new team for an enterprise, I would hire all of these highly skilled, self-motivated, committed, passionate folks, matured enough to respect & appreciate each others talent , who are diversified by their skillsets and multitude of talents but united by common goal with the prime focus to get AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 into flying colours.

Proud to be part of these great minds!
