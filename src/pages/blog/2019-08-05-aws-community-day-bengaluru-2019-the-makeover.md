When I sat down to write about AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 experience, it flashed "Why only about what happed on AWS Community Day?" and "Why not what was the effort made over 5 Months to put up this mega event?"  \
For me, in a nutshell, its more of learning to the hearts content to run a start-up IT Company.\
\
The ideation of 3rd AWS Community Day Bengaluru sparkled around mid Jan 2019, while the organizers of AWS User Group Bengaluru ([Jeevan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), [Sathyajith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sathyabhat/), [Runcy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/runcyoommen/), [Prashanth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hnprashanth/) & myself, [Bhuvaneswari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvanas/)) wanted to do it bigger and better, [Jeevan Dongre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevandongre/), the Lead AWS User Group Bengaluru & AWS Community Hero as usual have raised the bar high to have 800+ attendees (close to double compared to [AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2018](http://installjournal.blogspot.com/2018/09/aws-community-day-bengaluru-2018-day.html)), started exploring venues within the city limits. After couple of weeks' exploration and analysis, finalised Hotel Conrad for 27th July 2019 and the started backtracking the timeline with the end goal and big picture in mind. First this was to look beyond a day's event and thats how workshop was introduced in association with Konfhub

  Know your Speaker blog series was best in class automation & integration by Sathyajith  with 60 lines of quick coding in GO language.
  * User input to the typeform creates a trello card
  * The GO program reads the trello card and creates a blog post for the speaker in <https://www.awsugblr.in> as a draft.

* **Diversity Program**
  * Diversity Program have been by baby from day 1 and thanks to [Rashmi Sreedharan  ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashmis/)for all those brainstorming sessions. It was a great experience to devise a program with super good speakers  who has greater insight and much more experience in Diversity & Inclusion. Happy to collaborate with several #WomenInTech forums like WiMLDS - India, hersecondinnings.com, Women Who Code Bangalore, Infosecgirls & OWASPBangalore.
* **Agenda App was AWSome **
  * It is time aware, shows talks in current time slot when you open
    * attendee can create his/her own schedule for multi-track events
    * it has kiosk mode if conference organiser wishes to put this on a screen at the event and since it’s time aware it will always show current talk\

If I have the power to hire for a large enterprise, I would hire all of these highly skilled, self-motivated, committed, passionate folks, matured enough to respect & appreciate each others talent. Apparently they are are diversified by their skillsets and multitude of talents but united by common goal with the prime focus to get AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2019 into flying colours.

Proud to be part of these great minds!
